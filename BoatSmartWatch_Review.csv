I am satisfied with this product.",5.0,"I am using smart watch for the first time. Model is Xtend BOAT RTL which gives me a smart look. Easy to use, 5-6 days battery backup and it is very comfortable. I am fully satisfied and highly recommend to buy it. One thing which hurts, I bought this watch in Rs  1199.00 on 21.02.24 from amazon. And today, 02.03.24 the price reduced by Rs 200.00. I wish if amazon/concern retailer can refund me Rs 400.00 because I bought 2 watches in a single cart.", 2 March 2024

Good product.",4.0,"This smart (model Boat extend plus) watch is functioning well. Worth for price at Rs 2300/-Battery, in the beginning it lasted for 5 days and in the next charge it lasted for 3 days and last it settled to one day. I am not an extensive user of apps.AMOLED display is good.Touch feature is good. Access to apps is easily reachable. Simple browsing features.Sleep measurement is good. It is taking day time naps. But night time it's showing exactly when went to sleep and when I woke up.SpO2 measurement is neaarer to the measurement of my personal digital instrument.Heart rate measurement is also nearer to this instrument.Stress is also reflecting nearly my real condition.Activity: Steps showing correct.  Distance is also good but this watch is taking the bike ride as walking and showing when distance covered the set target.Sports features I haven't checked yet fully. But I checked that the features are functional.Water resistant - yes it is water resistant. I have checked while bathing and in drizzle of rain.Time display is good. The number of displays available on cloud is sufficient for me.Always on .. feature is working. Only model is available for this feature, which is not pleasing to me. There could be a few more skins made available.Display off and on when wrist is put to rest and raise respectively. This feature is only functional when the feature of Always On is enabled. Otherwise it's not functional.Bluetooth calling feature is good. Speaker is loud enough to take call. Useful in listening to audios and videos while walking.. ofcourse battery drains quickly.Messages: yes, it's good. We can see the notifications.Flash light is functioning. Ok.Camera, weather, calender, stopwatch, timer, alarm, breath are functioning.Find phone is beautiful.Settings are functional and are sufficient. It could be improved further to fine tune the functions.It's not measuring the heart rate etc when it is placed on surfaces other than human body. (I didn't check with animals.)..........ConsMusic volume is not that responsive. It's not controlling the audio of the app in real time.We cannot open and read the individual messages.Calender is for only current month. We cannot check the dates of rest of the months.Boat App is also good on my android Vivo phone. No issues with syncing.....I bought this watch to check the peaks of BP of my mom, especially during night time. Of course the manufacturers have not claimed the measurement of Blood Pressure. It's ok.Now I am using this have satisfaction.....My overal experience is good.", 27 August 2023

Good build quality & display. But not very smart.",3.0,"Skipping the parts mostly covered in other reviews and sponsored yt ones, I will add few irritants and common sense disappointments I noticed since last few days of actual usage of this NOT so smart watch:1.AOD do not show date & day of week. Only shows hour and mins. No way to configure it beyond analog/digital view. It also gets turned off when you start any exercise activity like walking. So the screen goes dark when you go for a walk!2. Calory count on home screen or anywhere else only shows step counts calories but not an aggregate calories burnt through exercise activities. I.e if step cals = 100 and cycling = 90 then it will only show 100 on home screen and separate two entries in app. Its not smart enough to do the addition.3. No quick way to go to and start the activity/exercise. First press side button twice then select activites list from menu. Versus Swipe up from home screen goes to utterly useless cricket score screen instead which many even won't use. No customisation of these menu options to functionality mapping provided.4. There is no touch to wake display available on screen. This is available on my 1800 rupee, 3 yr old huwai band 4! One has to press the side button every time just to see the home screen,which is utterly inconvenient to reach to.5. There is no day/night time auto on/off configuration of AOD or 'twist to wake' provided making it irritating during sleep hours if kept on. Thus daily two times a day its a task to enable/disable these features manually.Every freaking day!Kindly also note that there is indication, whatsoever, on AOD about the started exercise activity! So you start one, like outside walking, come home, and then after two hours discover you forgot to turn it off when you press the side button to activate the watch face screen!6. Unable to detect 20/30  mins power naps during the day time and add it to total 24 hr sleep tally. Only counts night time sleep hours that too with the average accuracy. As said before, not smart enough to do the simple math!7. Charging is fast but with even the AOD and BT calling disabled battery drains considerably in a day. Magnetic charger has its own down side e.g. gets disengaged at a minor twist tension on the charging cable.8. For activating the weather and cricket score features, user has to accept some opaque and unknown 3rd party (separate from Boat OEM opaque data privacy ones ) end user data usage policies. Without enabling GPS and/or contact/call logs access to mobile app none of these two features work. Which is very suspicious given their intended usage. Feb 23: After recent firmware update, now just to sync the data the mbl app needs gps turned on! O.w. it doesn't 'connect' to the watch over Bluetooth!9. If you remove the watch from the wrist and keep it aside, it keeps auto counting the heart rate and adds that lower count to average heart rate statistics! So to say it doesn't count the things to count and keeps counting the things not to count!10. Since installing the mobile app 'cove' I am observing rapid battery drain despite of restricting all the permissions and keeping bluetooth off. The bluetooth and sound level control functions of the phone are also randomly impaired for some unknown reasons and need phone restart to resolve.11. Sedentary remider most of the times do not get triggered when you are stationary but is notified after you start moving around!12. Cove App pushed firmware update completely wiped off all watch device setting preferences and resetting watch to all default settings, including the watch face, AOD, brightness level! The update also creepily asks to enable the gps without which it do not proceed! Now why does firmware update needs GPS??Its obvious that most of above issues/limitations can be easily fixed by software fixes and updates. But real question is do these so called dozens of smart watch chinese clone companies bother to give that much attention to details? And we know unfortunate answer to that question.", 9 August 2022

Good watch for all but requires improvement",4.0,"My experience with the boAt Xtend Call Plus Smart Watch has been somewhat ""ok ok,"" earning a middle-of-the-road rating. While it offers some useful features, the build quality leaves much to be desired, especially considering its price range.Starting with the positives, the 1.91"" HD display is impressive, providing clear visuals and easy navigation through multiple watch faces. The advanced BT calling is convenient, allowing me to take calls directly from the watch. The inclusion of HR and SpO2 tracking is beneficial for monitoring health metrics.However, I found the build quality of the smartwatch dial case disappointing. It is made of plastic, which gives it a cheap appearance, particularly given its price range. Many other smartwatches in the market offer metal build dial cases at a similar price point, making this aspect a notable drawback.The inclusion of ENx Tech and multiple sports modes adds versatility to the smartwatch, catering to different fitness activities. The support for English and Hindi languages is a nice touch, ensuring easy accessibility for users.In conclusion, while the boAt Xtend Call Plus Smart Watch has some useful features and a decent display, the average build quality and plastic dial case are significant downsides. For its price range, I expected a more premium feel and build material. There are other smartwatches in the market that offer better build quality and features at a similar cost. If you prioritize a sturdy and stylish design, it may be worth exploring alternative options before making a purchase.", 30 May 2023

NOt worth the money",3.0,"Review OverviewAverage2.7The Boat today launched the ‘ Boat Xtend ‘, the company’s latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs. 2,999. The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.", 17 May 2022

Best Budget watch",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.1) Large Curved  Display in this price category - 1.69 inch2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby  while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.2)  Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40  seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer.  In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while  traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.Few  other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.2) Remote shutter button for camera.3) Call silencing option could have been added.", 12 August 2021
